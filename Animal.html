	<h1>Animals</h1>
<p>
	<h2><u>Dogs</u></h2> 
	The dog (Canis familiaris or <strong>Canis lupus familiaris</strong>)is <strong>a domesticated descendant of the wolf.</strong> Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from an ancient, extinct wolf, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. Many work as assistance dogs, helping humans! 
	<br><br> Their nose secretes a special mucus that helps to absorb these chemicals, and then they lick their noses to sample them, helping them understand what the smell is.
	<br>Dogs are thought to be as smart as <strong>the wolves</strong>(and much easier to train!), so many owners teach them commands and tricks.
	<br><br><em>1.	Dogs are the most popular pet on the planet!</em>
	<br><em>2.	They can learn over 100 words and gestures!</em>
	<br><em>3.	Dog noses are at least 40x more sensitive than ours! </em>

<h2><u>Cats</u></h2>	
The cat (Felis catus) is<strong>a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.</strong> It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
<br><br> A cat has no collarbone, so it can fit through any opening the size of its head. The squishiest of cat facts!
<br>According to Veterinary Hub, Cats actually spend 70% of their lives sleeping, which works out to around 13-16 hours a day. It’s a cat’s life! 
<br><br><em>1.	The hearing of the average cat is at least five times keener than that of a human adult.</em>
<br><em>2.	In the largest cat breed, the average male weighs approximately 20 pounds.</em>
<br><em>3.	Domestic cats spend about 70 percent of the day sleeping. And 15 percent of the day grooming.</em>
